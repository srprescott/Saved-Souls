                    Please fill out and submit our Adoption Application. Once the application is submitted, it will be reviewed and, if approved, you will be contacted for a meet and greet. All of our dogs are adopted into BEST FIT homes - not on a first come, first serve basis. If there are multiple applicants for one dog, the best fit for that dog will be chosen and everybody will be informed of the decision. 
                    <br />  <br />
                    Adoption fees include, but are not limited to, age-appropriate vaccinations, dewormings, a visit with a licensed veterinarian for a wellness checkup, microchipping and spay/neuter. Adoption fees may vary dependent on situation but our standard adoption fee is $250.
                    <br />  <br />
                    Puppies under 6 months of age will be adopted out with an alteration contract to be upheld at 6 months of age. Dogs 7 months and older are subject to a one week trial period - this is explained further in the adoption application.

                Fill out and submit our foster application. It will be reviewed and determined if you would be accepted as a foster for our rescue. If accepted, your information (name and address) will be shared with the Department of Agriculture as a foster for our rescue, as required by the state. From there, you will be an active foster for our rescue! The foster application does let you specify breeds and ages of dogs that you would be most comfortable with fostering! 
                <br />  <br />
            </p>
            <div class="box">
                <p class="blurb blurb-adopt">You will always be asked ahead of time if you will be available to foster a dog (unless you ask/commit to a specific dog) - but you will never, EVER be pressured to take a dog (even if you commit to fostering it - I understand things change)! Fosters always have first option to adopt so long as the dog would be an appropriate long-term fit for the home. 
                <br />  <br />
                The rescue provides anything and everything needed to fosters including, but not limited to, crates, food, toys, leashes and collars, bath items, all vetting, etc - there is a section on the foster app to mark what you will need for your foster dog(s)! Fostering dogs is extremely rewarding and really helps save lives!
